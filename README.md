# BF-vs-p
A quick investigation on why Bayes factors (BFs) and p-values are correlated and why p-values are uniformly distributed under H0, following a Twitter discussion. This script contains code to 
* simulate BFs and p-values and plot their correlation 
* plot the relationship between effect sizes and p-values under H0, illustrating why p is uniformly distributed although d is not
